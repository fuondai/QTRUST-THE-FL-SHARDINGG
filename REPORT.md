## Project Overview

Q-TRUST is an advanced blockchain sharding solution that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize performance and security in blockchain systems. This project aims to address core blockchain challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and security by applying Q-learning algorithms to optimize transaction routing and adaptive consensus protocols.

Key contributions of the project include:
- Development of a DQN (Deep Q-Network) model to optimize transaction routing between shards
- Design of an adaptive consensus protocol based on node trust scores
- Implementation of detection and prevention mechanisms for common blockchain attacks
- Provision of a comprehensive simulation platform to evaluate performance under various scenarios

## Research Methodology

This research employs simulation methods to evaluate Q-TRUST's performance under different conditions. We developed a comprehensive simulation platform that allows:

1. **Comparison of different configurations:**
   - Basic: Basic sharding approach
   - Adaptive Consensus Only: Using only adaptive consensus protocol
   - DQN Only: Using only DQN routing
   - Q-TRUST Full: Combining both technologies

2. **Simulation of attack types:**
   - 51% attack
   - Sybil attack
   - Eclipse attack
   - Mixed attack

3. **Scalability testing:**
   - Simulation with varying numbers of shards and nodes
   - Evaluation of throughput and latency as network size increases

Key measurement parameters include:
- Throughput (transactions/second)
- Average latency (ms)
- Energy consumption
- Security score
- Cross-shard transaction rate

2. Integration with trusted execution environments for enhanced security
3. Implementation of privacy-preserving technologies within the federated learning framework
4. Extending the trust mechanism to incorporate reputation systems and identity verification
5. Exploring zero-knowledge proof integration for enhanced transaction privacy
